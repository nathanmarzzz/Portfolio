            <h1> Hello!</h1>
            <p>
                Hopefully you're on here because you're interested in hiring me. If that's the case, then here's everything you need to know about me:

            </p>
            <p>
                I'm Nathan Zadkovsky. There are many things and people I love. To name a few of the things, I love cooking and learning new recipes, 
                having music for every mood, coffee and tea, and everything tech.
                For all of the things I love, I do each with a careful and thorough curiosity, passion and hope to improve the quality of life for myself or those around me. 
                That's why I chose to pursue my B.S. in Computer Science at San Jose State University. Now, in my last year in university, I hope to join a company that has the same desire to help and make an impact.
                My interests in software include, but are not limited to: application/services development, automation, security and ML. And I plan to explore each as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                P.S. 
                If you're not here to hire me, this was still everything you needed to know about me.  
                Nice to meet you too.
                Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanzadkovsky/"> LinkedIn </a>and get to know me more.
