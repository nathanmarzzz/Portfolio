            <h1> Hello There</h1>
            <p>
                Hopefully you're on here because you're interested in hiring me. If that's the case, then here's everything you need to know about me:

            </p>
            <p>
                I'm Nathan Zadkovsky. There are many things and people I love. To name a few of the things, I love cooking and learning new recipes, 
                having music for every mood, coffee and tea (yes, both equally), and everything tech.
                For all of these the things I love, I do each with a careful and thorough curiosity, passion and hope to improve the quality of life for myself or those around me. 
                That's why I chose to pursue my B.S. in Computer Science at San Jose State University. Now, in my last year in university, I hope to join a company that has the same desire to help and make an impact.
                My interests in tech include, but are not limited to: Automation, Mobile App Development and Augmented and Virtual Reality. And I plan to explore each as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                P.S. 
                If you're not here to hire me, this was still everything you needed to know about me. 
                Now you know me. 
                Nice to meet you too.
                Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
                Information is below.
